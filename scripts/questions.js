                    answer: 'The northern fur seal is covered in a coat of fur due to natural selection. Over time, seals in that area who had a coat of fur outperformed those who did not, resulting in a higher fitness. Any organism with a greater chance of survival, will have a greater chance for reproduction. This increased the number of offspring from seals with a coat of fur, spread throughout the population over time, resulting in the fur covered seal that we see today.'

                    answer: 'Northern fur seals are endotherms that maintain an internal body temperature of about 97.7-99.5‚Å∞F irrespective of the temperature of their surroundings. In colder temperatures, the fur can trap air and keep them warm. The fur is also water-resistant so it regulates body temperature even under-water. This is important since the northern fur seals find their prey in water. Therefore, function determines form, as the fur aids in homeostasis so the seal can carry out its functions such as catching prey.'

                    answer: 'Northern fur seals need air to breath. When in water, they can hold their breath for a very long time. Also, since their function is to catch prey in water, and live in water for a long time, their form is organised in a way to be able to carry out this function. The seals have slits for nostrils that close under water. And their mouth and larynx is specialized such that they can eat underwater without swallowing any sea water.'

The only way they are related to other marine life is such that they share the same habitat, and are connected through food chains."
