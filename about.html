                        Naturalist Chat was created to let different naturalists present their opinions on different aspects of animals, may it be their characteristics, behaviours, or relationships with other animals. Around the world, there are many different ideas about how
                        animals came to be and their place in the natural world. Some people believe that God has created all the animals, while some now hold the opinion that evolution is the truth. We want everyone to understand the different views
                        of the most important naturalists and how these opinions apply to the different aspects of nature and wildlife.
                    </p>

                    <br />
                    <p>
                        We have invited some of the most important early naturalists to post on different questions asked about an animal of the month. Charles Darwin, Georges Cuvier, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, John Ray and William Paley have all generously agreed to participate
                        and share their views and opinions with the public. For our first month, we have chosen the Northern Fur Seal, and next month we will have a new animal with new questions. We hope everyone enjoys the different view presented, feel
                        free to like the different responses.

                    <h6>Different Fur Seal Species</h6>
                    <p>The large northern fur seal, found in chilly northern waters, was hunted to near extinction during the 19th century. These animals were protected by law in 1911, and populations later rebounded to 1.3 million animals. There are eight
                        species of southern fur seals, all smaller than their northern relative. They include the Guadalupe fur seal of Baja California, the brown fur seal of southern Africa and Australia, and the South American fur seal.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h6>Senses and Behavior</h6>
                    <p>Fur seals have sharp eyesight and keen hearing. They have small ears, unlike the earless or hair seals. Although they breathe air, seals are most at home in the water and may stay at sea for weeks at a time eating fish, squid, birds,
                        and tiny shrimp-like krill. Fur seals may swim by themselves or gather in small groups.</p>
                    <br />
                    <h6>Breeding Season</h6>
                    <p>When breeding season arrives, however, these social animals gather on shore in very large numbers. Powerful males, known as bulls, establish territories and gather harems of up to 40 females, battling their rivals to establish dominance.
                        During this season, coastlines are filled with roaring, growling, honking seals. Female fur seals, or cows, give birth during this breeding season, then mate again just a few days later. The following year they will return to give
                        birth to a single pup after a nearly yearlong pregnancy, and mate once again to continue the cycle. Many fur seal populations have not rebounded from extensive hunting, and now face additional threats from climate change and overfishing,
                        which can limit their prey.</p>
